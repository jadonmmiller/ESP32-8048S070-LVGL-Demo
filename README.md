# ESP32-8048S070-LVGL-Demo
This is my code to get LVGL up-and-running on this great dev board!

Note: In order to make PlatformIO include the LVGL demo files when it compiles, please move the ".pio\libdeps\sunton_s3\lvgl\demos" folder to ".pio\libdeps\sunton_s3\lvgl\src". This should fix any "undefined reference" errors.
